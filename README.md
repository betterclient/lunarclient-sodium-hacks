# Lunar Client Sodium Hacks

**DISCLAIMER: DON'T USE THIS ON SERVERS YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION IN, THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.**

## How does it work?

It uses the [Override](https://support.lunarclient.com/support/solutions/articles/60000752051-third-party-mods) feature from the **official lunar** launcher without anything hacky.
It just replaces the sodium module on lunar client 1.19.3 with the **~~hacks~~ utility mods.**

## How use?

Launch the "sodium-util.jar" file and run lunar client with the sodium module!

## How to build?

Build this project using the `jar` task, don't use the build task as it remaps mc and we don't want that.
Run the jar file generated.
Now run lunar client with the sodium module!
